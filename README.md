Alcohol consumption is a very common problem faced by high school students and this affects their final grade.
So there are some factors which has a significant effent on their grades like mother and father education, studytime, work day and weekend alcohol consumption.
After applying Linear Regression and Random foest we saw that there is issue of overfitting so we chose to use Kfold cross validation. As we do not have lvery large amount of data
we choose cv as 10, k=12 and then we got a test score of 85%
